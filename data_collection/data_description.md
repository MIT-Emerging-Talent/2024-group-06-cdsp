# Data Description: Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA)

The Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA) is a comprehensive monitoring system launched in December 2019 to collect primary data on attacks targeting healthcare facilities and personnel. Developed as part of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, the SSA focuses on emergency-affected countries and fragile, conflict-affected, and vulnerable settings.

The SSA collects standardized data on various types of attacks, including but not limited to psychological violence, removal of health care assets, removal of health care personnel or patients, setting fires, sexual assault, and violence involving heavy or individual weapons. This data provides valuable insights into the frequency, severity, and geographic distribution of attacks on health care, aiding in the identification of trends and hotspots.

Users can access the SSA dashboard to view aggregated global data and filter it for tailored analysis. The system aims to enhance understanding, response, and prevention of attacks on health care by providing timely and reliable information to policymakers, healthcare providers, and humanitarian organizations.
