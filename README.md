## 🌐 Overview

Welcome to the readme for our project focused on analyzing the impact of attacks on healthcare facilities in conflict zones. Our diverse team, hailing from 🇨🇦**Canada**, 🇩🇪**Germany**, 🇬🇷**Greece**, and 🇺🇦**Ukraine**, collaborates to address this critical issue from a global perspective.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

### Attacks on Healthcare Facilities: A Global Crisis

Our team explores the devastating effects of attacks on healthcare facilities in conflict zones, examining the direct impacts on service delivery, infrastructure damage, and human casualties. These attacks not only disrupt healthcare services but also have far-reaching implications on global health security and international humanitarian law.

### Core Issues

1. **Service Disruption:** The immediate halt of healthcare services following attacks, affecting emergency and routine care.
2. **Infrastructure Damage:** The physical destruction of healthcare facilities, leading to long-term service discontinuity.
3. **Casualties:** The toll on human life, including healthcare workers and patients, resulting from these violent attacks.

### Global Impact

We highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of how these attacks contribute to broader healthcare system vulnerabilities. Our investigation aims to uncover patterns and systemic weaknesses, guiding the development of strategies to protect healthcare services and improve resilience in conflict-affected areas.
