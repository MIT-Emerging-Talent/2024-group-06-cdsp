## Storytelling: Understanding the Impact

In the narrative of our project, we delve into the harsh realities faced by countries experiencing conflicts, where the toll on healthcare facilities is devastating. Countries are not just facing healthcare distractions, but they often have to pay twice the price with additional injuries and deaths.

**Time for countries in war means more attacks...**

In times of conflict, the frequency of attacks on healthcare facilities increases, leading to a compounding effect on the already fragile healthcare systems.

**Unequal Impact: Not all countries are affected equally...**

However, it's crucial to recognize that the impact is not uniform across all countries. Disparities exist in the number of attacks and the resulting death toll. While some countries may experience fewer attacks, the number of deaths can paint a more accurate picture of the severity of the situation.

**More attacks do not mean more deaths!**

Surprisingly, the number of attacks doesn't always correlate with the number of deaths. Factors such as the effectiveness of emergency response, the availability of medical resources, and the resilience of communities play a significant role in determining the outcome.

**People Over Numbers: Despite fewer attacks...**

Ultimately, what matters most is the human toll. Despite there being fewer reported attacks in some regions, the toll on people surpasses the mere numerical count of incidents. Each attack represents not just a statistic, but a tragedy that affects countless lives.

In our presentation, we aim to capture these nuanced realities through interactive dashboards, visualizing the data and analysis to provide a deeper understanding of the impact of attacks on healthcare facilities in conflict-affected regions.
