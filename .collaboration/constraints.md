# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over. they may include:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
